**Here is the description of my hands free switch**

**“Light up The Way Back Home”**

For my handless switch, I decided to control the circuit by a straw and my mouth. The scene I want to simulate is the light with a motion sensor in our daily life, which will come on when someone enters. The idea of the setting is inspired by the motion sensor light in one of the restrooms in C2.

I first retraced what we have done last week, and based on it, I added another LED to form a simple parallel circuit. I then built a small house using cardboard and the glue gun. The house has two rooms, one with a red LED on the roof, another with a green one. The breadboard is covered by the roof. The floor is made of the aluminum foil as the conductor.

The default broken connection (both LEDs are off) can be switched to a complete circuit simply by controlling the aluminum foil on the wire to the aluminum foil at the bottom of the house. I took a longer wire than the ones in our packages, so it can be more easily adjusted. Once the wire touches the foil, the circuit completes and the corresponding LED would light up (room on the left connected to a red LED; room on the right connected to a green LED).

Although the principle is quite straightforward, I struggled to make the connection stable. At first, I used copper tape instead of aluminum foil, but it turned out that the LED sometimes did not come on. I did not realize that it was the material issue until I tried aluminum foil which makes the connection work well. The reason is that all areas of the aluminum foil are conductive while only one side of the copper tape is conductive. I also tried to control the wire by blowing, but when I tested it I realized that I could not determine the direction precisely and the wire is too heavy to blow.
